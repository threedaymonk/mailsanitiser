# Daily Mail Cleaner

This is a Chrome extension inspired by [Andy Beaumont’s Daily Mail Cleaner
Safari extension][ab]:

> You know that feeling you get when you accidentally click on a link to an
> article on the Daily Mail website? You know that red mist that descends when
> you see that sidebar full of pictures ridiculing celebrities for having
> cellulite or being overweight? You know how your blood pressure goes through
> the roof when you accidentally read one of the comments? Well, here’s a
> safety net for your browser.

If you accidentally visit a Daily Mail page, this extension will replace it
with a version filtered through Instapaper’s page cleaner, removing the Sidebar
of Shame, the comments, and various other junk.

## Installation

Visit [Mail Cleaner on the Google Web Store][gws] and choose *Add to Chrome*.
